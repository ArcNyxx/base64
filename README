base64
======

base64 is a small code library for simply encoding and decoding binary data to
and from a printable format.

philosophy
----------

Created to be the fastest base64 encoder/decoder which conforms to the
following criteria:
- readable by programmers of any skill level
- easily translatable into other programming languages
- cross-platform and system

Such criteria disallow things like SIMD or endianness checking, rendering this
codebase subpar for any heavy-duty application
