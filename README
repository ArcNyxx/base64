base64 - base64 encoding/decoding library
=========================================
base64 is a tiny library for encoding and decoding binary data to and from
base64 format, defined in RFC 4648. This library is not designed for heavy use,
yet it is perfect for applications which are small or must use minimal memory,
or for quick testing purposes.

Philosophy
----------
base64 is made to be the fastest base64 encoder/decoder which conforms to the
following criteria:

    must not overuse memory (no huge lookup tables)
    must be readable by anyone (for ease of translation into other languages)
    must be cross-platform (no memory endianness tricks or SIMD)


Using base64
------------
There are multiple library functions, each detailed in separate man pages which
are installed alongside the library. Here is a list of each exposed function:

    base64_encode(const char *restrict input, size_t length,
            char *restrict buffer)
    base64_decode(const char *restrict input, size_t length,
            char *restrict buffer)
    base64_verify(const char *string, size_t length)
