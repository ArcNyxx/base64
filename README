base64 - simple encoding library
================================
base64 is a tiny library for encoding and decoding binary data to and from
base64 format, as defined in RFC 4648.  base64 is designed to be simple and
fast while also being cross-platform and having a small memory footprint for
use in embedded applications.

Installation
------------
base64 comes with a Makefile and config.mk file for configurable building and
testing.  Edit the latter to match your local setup (base64 is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default, you may need to modify your $PATH).

base64 can be built and installed with the following command (run as root):

    make clean install
